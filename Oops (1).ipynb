This means a child class can access the functionalities of multiple base classes. It promotes code reusability and helps in combining behaviors from different classes into one. However, it can also lead to ambiguity when two parent classes have methods with the same name. Python resolves such conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO), which follows a specific order (left to right as defined in the class) to determine which method to call."

    "Ans-22 @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that aren't tied to a specific instance of the class. However, they differ in functionality and use cases. A @staticmethod does not take any implicit first argument like self or cls. It behaves like a regular function but is placed inside the class for logical grouping. It cannot access or modify the class or instance state and is typically used for utility functions. On the other hand, a @classmethod takes cls as the first argument, which refers to the class itself. This allows it to access or modify class-level data and is often used for factory methods or tasks related to the class as a whole. The main difference is that @staticmethod is completely independent of the class or instance, while @classmethod is aware of the class context."
